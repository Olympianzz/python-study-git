### Solution
###### vowelCount.py
`sum()` **:** <br/>
Syntax: <br/>
`sum(iterable,start)` <br/>
It first sums start,then the elements in the iterable from left to right.

iterable: list, tuple, dict, etc. The elements of the iterables must be numbers. The other data structures can not be used as a parameter of iterables to use sum function. <br/>

start: the value of start is 0 by default. Firstly, start is added to the sum, then iterables are calculated. <br/>

**Example** <br/>
`list = [1,2,3,4]` <br/>
`total = sum(list)` <br/>

If the question was "Count the number of vowels starting from 10 in a given string", then the solution would be <br/>
countVowelStartingWith10.py
